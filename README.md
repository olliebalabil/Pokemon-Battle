# Pok√©mon Battle App
SPA app allowing two users to have a pokemon battle. After inputting player names, the users can select moves to play.

## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the repository and call `npm install` in the terminal.
- Call `npm run dev` in the terminal and, in the browser, navigate to the specified local root.


## Bugs
- A user is able to click any buttons displayed, even when it isn't the respective player's turn. This leads to the power of the move being taken away from the wrong pokemon.

## Future Features
- Allow users to switch between pokemon.
- More styling.
- Some sort of way to display that a pokemon has fainted.
